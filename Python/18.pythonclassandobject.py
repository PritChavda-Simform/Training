# Create a Class
class MyClass:
  x = 5

# Creating Object
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)

# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

# It does not have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
